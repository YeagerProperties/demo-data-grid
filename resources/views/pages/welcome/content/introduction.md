## Introduction

Data Grid is a framework agnostic package that makes it fantastically easy to handle large data sources. It shifts the focus from pagination to data filtration. Pass any data source through a data handler and the package will take care of the rest so you can use the filtered result set to create your applications.

The package requires PHP 5.5.9+ and follows the FIG standards PSR-1, PSR-2, and PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code and is fully unit-tested.
