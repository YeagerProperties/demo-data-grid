## 1. <a name="instantiation"></a> Instantiation

Data grids can be instantiated through the `DataGridManager` which is responsible for handling all aspects of a grid as well as the routes.

```
var dg = new DataGridManager();

var options = {

    source: "data_grid_source_url",
    ...

};

dg.create('demo-grid', options);
```

The example above will create a new grid named `demo-grid`.
