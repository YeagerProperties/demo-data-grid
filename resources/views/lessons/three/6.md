# 6. <a name="sorting-data"></a> Sorting data

Sorting requires adding the `data-grid-sort="column"` attribute to the element that should trigger sorting. One often used element is a table header cell.

Sorting toggles between three states, `asc`, `desc` and none which will fall back to the default grid sorting.

```
<th data-grid-sort="country">Country</th>
```
