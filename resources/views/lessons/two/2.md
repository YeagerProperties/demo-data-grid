Layout containers are the main wrappers data grid data should be rendered into.

They are defined by adding a `data-grid-layout=":name"` attribute to the desired HTML element. Every element that has a layout defined will be automatically rendered using a matching template.

Lets consider a basic example where we need a single layout container that should wrap our results. This should be placed wherever the results should be output on your markup.

```
<div data-grid-layout="results"></div>
```

Every layout should have a matching template that will be rendered into it.
