# 5. <a name="creating-a-data-grid-object"></a> Creating a data grid object

The data grid class is the class responsible for binding the different parts together and returning the result set.

It receives an instance of the data handler as first argument, and a second optional argument consisting of a request provider or an array of parameters.

```
DataGrid::make($handler, [
    'filters' => [
        'country' => 'US',
    ],
    'page' => 5,
]);
```
