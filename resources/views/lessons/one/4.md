# 4. <a name="handlers"></a> Handlers

Handlers are responsible for the data source validation and applying the various applied filters, sorts and pagination.

## Out-of-the-box handlers

### `CollectionHandler`

Part of the data grid package and has a namespace of `Cartalyst\DataGrid\DataHandlers\CollectionHandler`.

This handler is responsible for dealing with data that is either an array or an instance of a `Cartalyst\Collections\Collection` class.

It is a quick and easy way for grids that do not deal with large result sets since the result set size will affect any operations that will be executed on it.

```
$handler = new CollectionHandler($data, $settings);
```

### `DatabaseHandler`

Part of the data grid laravel package and has a namespace of `Cartalyst\DataGrid\Laravel\DataHandlers\DatabaseHandler`.

This handler is responsible for dealing with `Illuminate` data sources.

The main advantage of using the `DatabaseHandler` is its abilities to only process the required data by limiting the fetched results in the first place.

This makes a huge difference especially when dealing with larger data sets.

It supports the following objects as source.

- `Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder`
- `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model`
- `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder`
- `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsToMany`

```
$model = new FooModel();

$handler = new DatabaseHandler($model, $settings);
```

The example above will use the `FooModel` to perform all the data related operations.

## Settings

Handlers can optionally receive various settings passed as a second argument on instantiation.
