Data grid consists of a few classes that interact with each other to produce the grids and can be broken down into front end & back end parts.

### Front end parts

#### Javascript Plugin

The javascript plugin is responsible for providing the front end features of data grid and fires the requests with the proper parameters to retrieve the results according to the selected arguments.

#### Markup & Templates

Data Grid relies mainly on html data attributes to define its building blocks and functionalities.

[Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) templates are used to define and render the various templates required for the grid.

### Back end parts

1. [Request Providers](#providers)
2. [Data Handlers](#handlers)
3. [Data Grid](#data-grid-object)
