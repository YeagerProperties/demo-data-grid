# 3. <a name="providers"></a> Providers

Providers are responsible for feeding data grid with any applicable arguments that should affect the result set. Be it filters, sorts or the page, these are all examples of arguments data grid can fetch data based on.

## Out-of-the-box providers

### `RequestProvider`

This is data grid's default provider, it uses a Symfony Request object under the hood to fetch the arguments from the url.

```
DataGrid::make($handler);
```

This call will default to the RequestProvider to extract the arguments.

### `ArrayProvider`

This provider extracts the arguments from an array rather than relying on the url params.

```
DataGrid::make($handler, ['page' => 1]);
```

This example will only retrieve the arguments passed as an array to the `make` call and will not change based on url params.
